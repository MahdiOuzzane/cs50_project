# cs50_project
this is my final project for the course CS50 that  I took in edx website
the pupose of the website is to provide a virtual library that keeps track of books hold by people that no longer need them.
the owner can give, trade or sell there books just by register them in our database by providing some related information about the book (title, location, price if it is for sell, ...).
for those who looking for books with the lowest price and the closest to him visit the website and search for the book in the searching bar.
